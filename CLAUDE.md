## Branches

| Branch | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `main` | Default branch on remote |
| `master` | Local default branch |

## Development Notes

- **No package manager or build system** is configured (no `package.json`, `Makefile`, etc.)
- **No linting, formatting, or testing** tools are set up
- **No CI/CD** pipelines exist (no `.github/workflows/`)
- **No environment variables** or secrets configuration

## Conventions for AI Assistants

- Do not assume this is the open-source [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) commenting system — this is a separate repository under `freshkevin1`
- When adding code, establish appropriate tooling (package manager, linter, formatter) before building features
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive
- Avoid committing large binary files without LFS configuration
